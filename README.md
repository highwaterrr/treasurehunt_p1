There is an admin panel where the  Dash board and user data insights are also displayed and admin palnel shows the status of the game completion of the user.

# Skills Assessed
Through this game, the verbal or communicational and reasoning or problem-solving skills of the users are assessed, and at the last question, the memory and alertness of the user are also assessed. Thus this game assesses the soft skills of the user and helps them to improve their skills. The reasoning questions are framed such that there can be more than one correct answer for the question based on the logic applied. But the user has to guess the correct logic that will make him enter the correct path. There are dead-ends in the project which will arise when users fail to get the correct logic required for solving the question.

# Technologies Used
This project is made from scratch and no templated were used. This uses the Django framework which is one of the best-suited frameworks for these kinds of projects. Some javascript is also used for some functionalities to work such as timer and all. It uses the MVT architecture and thus the models.py of the repository has the database model that is used.
There are 2 tables used for this project:\

Users: Stores the user details.\
Treasure: Stores the status of the user.
The code is not much complicated and is easy to understand. The dead-ends are also linearly arranged and simple logic is applied for tha

# Installation

Windows
It is required to have Python installed in the system.
It is necessary to check if your requirements are already installed, please refer requirements.txt file in the repository.
you can install the dependencies as follows:

    >  pip install -r requirements.txt
For installation, It is recommended to create a virtual environment. You can use the following command for creating a virtual environment:

    > python -m venv {name}
now you can paste the files in this virtual environment, and then once you are ready you can activate the virtual environment as:

    > {name}\scripts\activate  
Now enter into the directory (where you copied the repo.)

    > cd {folder name}
Now you can run the server with the following command:

    > python manage.py runserver
You will get the URL and the browser will be started automatically and the puzzle (website) will be hosted on your local server.
